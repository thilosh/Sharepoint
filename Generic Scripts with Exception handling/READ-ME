If there a requirement to create a very large number of SharePoint Site column, Content Types, List and security permissions group. There are different ways which you can achieve this.
1.	Through UI
2.	Through Code (.cs) files using SharePoint object model
3.	Through elemet.xml the template provided in VS
4.	Through PowerShell
 
So instead of creating a PowerShell script which is specific to your project. U can just create a script which is generic and can be used by other people
 
This consists of CSV files which has schema for each of Site column, Content type, list creation and permission definition for the site.
each has PowerShell scripts which pulls the data from the respective CSV files and runs on the site collection provided in CSV,
 
The CSV has samples, you can edit those or add new entries into the CSV.
 
This will help in Bulk creation of SharePoint site columns, Content types etc. with ease!!
 
 
Steps to run the script are
1.	Site Columns
2.	Content types
3.	Lists
4.	Permissions
